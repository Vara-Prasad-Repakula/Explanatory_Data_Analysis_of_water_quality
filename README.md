### About the Project 💡
Python Programming language along with data analytical skills are implemented 🧑🏻‍💻 on a publicly available dataset to find out the effectiveness of individual water quality metrics 📈 like
- Water hardness
- PH level
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic_carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity etc... on the potability of water 🚰 (suitable to drink or not).

### Conclusion 😃
After a thorough Explanatory Data Analysis, it is concluded that the potability of water is not just limited to exceeding the limit of one particular quality of water. The potability is a mixed reaction of many factors. It is highly unpredictable to decide whether water is able to drink or not based on only one metric value.
